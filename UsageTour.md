# A Tour of Usage

## Starting Emacs
The default startup buffer is disabled, instead, a buffer named **Buffer List**
is opened and presented to you.

From the start, it is empty. In your daily usage, of emacs, if you find that you
access some directory or file frequently, you could add the file location in the
to the bookmark of Emacs by issuing the following command:

`C-x r m`(or menu->edit->Bookmarks->set) or `M-x bookmark-set`

To make your bookmark setting effective accross Emacs Sessions, **Do not forget**
to run execute the following command
`M-x bookbark-save`.

The bookmarks saved will be shown in the **Bookmark Lists** the next time your start
Emacs.

## Winner mode
We usually use `C-x 2` `C-x 3` `C-x 0` `C-x 1` etc, to manage our windows in Emacs.
Sometimes, we need to restore our previous window setting.
* Restore `C-x 4 u`
* Redo `C-x 4 r`
